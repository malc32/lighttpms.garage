Privacy Policy
Please read it carefully, thank you.

  1. Collection and use of information
  (1) The application asks for location permits because the BLE detection system requires them, for no reason Alimedperu asks the device for the GPS position, much less shares it since it only has Internet permissions to monetize the application.
(2) Alimedperú will strictly follow the relevant laws and regulations and the content of this privacy policy to collect and use your information.
2. Review of this Privacy Policy
  Although this privacy statement describes the standards that Alimedperú continues to protect privacy, these standards can change. If there is an update, Alimedperu will notify you the changes and the date of validity of the way that it is considered appropriate when the revised version is published.
